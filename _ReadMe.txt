Please read this file before launching the MySQL-PHP test.

1. Make sure Apache server and MySQL server are both turned on.

2. Run the attached "Spirit_database.sql" which will create the database "infs3800project_db" as well as the tables "animatronics" and "login" with five columns and five rows, in addition to new user joe/joe123. Joe should have sufficient privileges to operate on the database.   

3. Using a browser, open "Login.php" or you can go to "Index.php" and click on "Account"->"Sign-in" in the menu. 

4. Once you've signed in using jma/jma123, you'll be able to search the website's data by clicking on the "Search" button in the menu (or you can just open "Search.php") where you'll be prompted to enter values to search.

5. Enter a letter or word and click "Search Database" to see results.
